# Rock paper scissors

A simple version of a classic Rock Paper Scissors game created as a practice project for Javascript Foundations course in the Odin Project[https://www.theodinproject.com/].

A game is played in the console against the computer. A user is prompted by the browser to input either rock/paper/scissors. The whole game consists of 5 rounds and the final score is displayed in the end of the game.
